# What really grinds my gears?

## The problem

![SKY](https://corporate.sky.com/file.axd?pointerid=8d70e59f38a849d8bb4bca854ca1c7dd)

When I spend 3h to choose which movie to watch with my friends.


## What pains needs to be solved?

Taking to much time to decide on something that shouldn't take a long time.


## The focus is on

Our focus need to be on having something that is really fast, simple and fun.


## The inspiration

Today we consume content really fast, we want to enjoy all out available time the best we can do. An sometimes is whatching a movie either at home of at the movie theater.
It made sence from the begining to do something inpired on Tinder, Like; Don't Like.


## MVP

We want to create something that can be used for home cinema (video on demand), but the way we created we made it think on expanding to movie theater.

We need to have a way to create an event realy fast, no need to create account or wait for friends to join the app before we create an event, yes we still need to way for them, but I guess some of us are use to it.

Next we filter the coices by asking what genere does he like, to test it our on our MVP we give 8 and he needs to pick 5 of them. And this is a "magic" number. With this we are making sure that we raise our changes of having generes overlapped.

With 5 generes selected we generate a random list of 5 movies for each genere, so we will show the user 25 movies for him to choose. Why this limitation, we don't want the users to be swiping all day. And now swipe away your options. You have the Like/ Don't Like and a finish early buttons.

No one knows what the results are until the owner of the event decides to close the event or when the deadline is reached.

After that every one will know what was the pick.


## The future

If the result is a tie, you will get the oportunity that will be available for just a feew moments, the user will need to be quick and participate on a roulette to find the winner.
Make this usable for movie theater.
Have user accounts and store what are the likes for each user. But when that stage comes, we need to collect user mood.
The recomendations will be more close to the users mood and likings.
When we are hosting a movie session at home during the swiping stage, you will have the opportunity to say like to what you would like to have, like popcorns, beear, some snacks...
